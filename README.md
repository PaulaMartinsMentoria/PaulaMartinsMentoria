 Hi, I’m @PaulaMartinsMentoria

👀 I’m interested in personal development, holistic health, and empowering others to discover their divine potential.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about integrative wellness practices and the latest methodologies in self-care and I am creating my app in FlutterFlow 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on workshops, speaking engagements, and projects that focus on mental and emotional well-being.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me through my Instagram @paulamartins_mentoria or email me at paulatmartins@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: I once turned my life experiences into a unique mentorship program that blends spirituality with practical self-care techniques!
